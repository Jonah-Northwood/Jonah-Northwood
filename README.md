Hello!

I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota Morris and have recently completed a bootcamp in Data Analytics with Hack the Gap. I've previously done work developing website with Drupal and am working on making a game engine using C++. I love all things nature and have spent a lot of time the last few years road tripping to national parks all over the country and love sharing time in nature and stories with others.
